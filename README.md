The purpose of this site is to provide a point of reference for future inquiries.
This includes (but is not limited to) collaborations, potential employers, or inquiries about my existing projects.

The layout is very simple. It's as follows:

Mainpage (index) -> About me -> Mainpage
Mainpage -> Resume -> Mainpage
Mainpage -> GitHub
Mainpage -> LinkedIn

It's really simple, and that's the point. 
It's meant to optimize my communications, and it does that job perfectly.
Can't argue with that.
