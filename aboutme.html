        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Alexander Dao (I go by Alex), and I'm a fourth year undergrad at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
            <p>My main areas of focus are Computer Science and Linguistics, particularly in AI and ML.</p>  
            <p>Besides school, a lot of what I do on my free time is hands-on. I'm a bit eclectic when it comes to my hobbies.</p>
            <p>Some of these hobbies include cooking, the outdoors, working with computers, concerts, <br> whatever just so happens to tickle my fancy at the moment.</p>
